**Project: Address Book**  
Write a program that functions as an address book. It should have entries containing at least the following information: first and last name, phone number, address, and email address. You should be able to add entries and remove entries, as well as printing out any given entry. It should save entries to a file, and be able to read in entries from a file as well.

The address book must be able to sort by at least one field (preferably last name). You may use any sort for this that you like.
